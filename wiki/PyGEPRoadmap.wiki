= Introduction =
This is the development road map going toward a 1.0 release.  I'll add tickets to these as they become pertinent.

= Current Status =
=== v0.1 ===
 * Issue #5: Inversion error with head length=1
 * Issue #7: Windows installation issues

= Future PyGEP Releases =
=== v0.2 ===
 * Issue #2: Performance enhancement of population cycling and chromosome evaluation
 * Issue #3: It may be useful to change multigenic chromosomes so that, instead of being one list, they are collections of unigenic chromosomes.  That way they could cache sub-ET evaluation results between chromosomes.

=== v0.3 ===
 * More demos!
 * Improvements to the function and linker libraries.
