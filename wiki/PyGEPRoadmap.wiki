#summary Where is PyGEP going?

= Introduction =
These is the development road map going toward a 1.0 release.  I'll add tickets to these as they become pertinent.


= Future PyGEP Releases =
== v0.2 ==
 * Ticket #2: Performance enhancement of population cycling and chromosome evaluation - this hasn't even been breeched yet.
 * Ticket #3: It may be useful to change multigenic chromosomes so that, instead of being one list, they are collections of unigenic chromosomes.  That way they could cache sub-ET evaluation results between chromosomes.

== v0.3 ==
 * More demos!
 * Improvements to the function and linker libraries.
