#summary Introduction to PyGEP

_Latest release: PyGEP-0.1-beta_

= What is it? =

PyGEP is a simple library suitable for academic study of GEP (Gene Expression Programming) in Python, aiming for ease of use and rapid implementation.

 It provides standard multigenic chromosomes; a population class using elitism and fitness scaling for selection; mutation, crossover and transposition operators; and some standard GEP functions and linkers.

= What does it do? =

PyGEP provide an implementation of most standard GEP components:
  * Unigenic and multigenic chromosomes and evaluation
  * Populations and generational cycling
  * Mutation, crossover, and transposition operators
  * Function libraries for arithmetic, logic and comparison
  * Multigenic linkers

= How do I use it? =

There are a couple [http://pygep.googlecode.com/svn/tags/pygep-0.1-beta/src/demo/ demos] available based on those in [http://gene-expression-programming.com/GEPBiblio.asp the papers of Ferreira].  Check back here soon for a [wiki:SymbolicRegressionTutorial tutorial].
