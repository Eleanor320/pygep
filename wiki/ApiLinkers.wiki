#summary PyGEP Linkers for Sub-ETs

= Introduction =
`pygep.functions.linkers` provide two standard GEP linkers for linking the evaluation of genes.  These are passed to ApiPopulations during instantiation. 

= Linkers =
 * *default_linker*: returns a single result of evaluation for unigenic chromosomes, a tuple of results for multigenic
 * *sum_linker*: adds the results each gene's evaluation
 * *or_linker*: boolean ORs the results of each gene's evaluation
