Q:	How can I write my own GEP functions?
A:	Simple:

        from pygep.chromosome import symbol
       
        @symbol('~')
        def foo(x, y, z):
			return bar(x, y, z)

	Now you can use foo in your chromosomes just like any of the provided 
	functions. If your function uses a single character name, you do not need 
	to use the symbol decorator. The arity of non-terminal functions is culled
	from its func_code.co_argcount, meaning that using *args or **kwds will 
	not do anything.

	See pygep.functions for examples.


Q:	Can I provide my own linkers?
A:	Of course! A PyGEP linker just needs to accept *args and return a single 
	result. See the sum_linker code for an example:

		def sum_linker(*args):
			'''Returns the sum of all sub-ETs'''
		    return sum(args)

	If you do not provide a linker for your population, the default linker will 
	simply return the top results of each gene's evaluation.
