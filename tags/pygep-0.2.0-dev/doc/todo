Where is PyGEP going?
Introduction

This is the development road map going toward a 1.0 release. I'll add tickets
to these as they become pertinent.


Current Status
--------------
v0.2
    * Issue #2: Performance enhancement of population cycling?
    * Issue #3: It may be useful to change multigenic chromosomes so that, 
                instead of being one list, they are collections of unigenic 
                chromosomes. That way they could cache sub-ET evaluation 
                results between chromosomes. 


Future Releases
---------------
v0.3
    * Issue #8: random numerical constants (RNCs) via the special '?' terminal
    * Improvements to the function and linker libraries. 

v0.4
    * Issue #10: conversion of GEP chromosomes to Python code
    * Issue #11: provide .deb packages

v0.5:
	* ADFs via hemeotic genes
