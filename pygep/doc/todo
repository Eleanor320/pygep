Where is PyGEP going?
Introduction

This is the development road map going toward a 1.0 release.


Current Status
--------------
v0.2 beta testing & v0.3 development


Future Releases
---------------
v0.3
    * Issue #3: minor optimizations to gene evaluation 
    * Issue #8: random numerical constants (RNCs) via the special '?' terminal
    * Issue #13: Built-in function library hierarchy
      - Reorganization of pygep.functions hierarchy to accommodate more:
        - Add min_op, max_op, ln_op, log2_op, log10_op, etc.
      - For each function package, provide an ALL (or something) tuple
      - Standardization of names (all like function_op or function_linker)
      - Determine whether or not to use function closure by default
    * Issue #14: Raise SemanticError on missing attributes in gene evaluations
      - SemanticError should only catch AttributeErrors before actual eval,
        everything else is raised as before.
    * Issue #15: Should GEP NCs convert to floating point by default

v0.4
    * Issue #10: conversion of GEP chromosomes to Python code
    * Issue #11: provide .deb packages
    * Issue #16: make PyGEP thread-safe

v0.5:
    * Issue #17: ADFs via homeotic genes
